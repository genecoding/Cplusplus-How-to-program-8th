17.12 (Telephone Number Word Generator) Standard telephone keypads contain the digits 0
through 9. The numbers 2 through 9 each have three letters associated with them, as is indicated by
the following table:

Digit | Letter | Digit | Letter
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- 
2 | A B C | 6 | M N O
3 | D E F | 7 | P Q R S
4 | G H I | 8 | T U V
5 | J K L | 9 | W X Y Z

Many people find it difficult to memorize phone numbers, so they use the correspondence
between digits and letters to develop seven-letter words that correspond to their phone numbers.
For example, a person whose telephone number is 686-2377 might use the correspondence indicated 
in the above table to develop the seven-letter word “NUMBERS.”

Write a program that, given a seven-digit number, writes to a file every possible seven-letter
word corresponding to that number. There are 2187 (3 to the seventh power) such words. Avoid
phone numbers with the digits 0 and 1.
