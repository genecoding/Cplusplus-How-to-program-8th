8.17 (Generating Mazes Randomly) Write a function mazeGenerator that randomly produces a
maze. The function should take as arguments a two-dimensional 12-by-12 character array and
pointers to the int variables that represent the row and column of the mazeâ€™s entry point. Try your
function mazeTraverse from Exercise 8.16, using several randomly generated mazes.
