6.28 (Perfect Numbers) An integer is said to be a perfect number if the sum of its divisors, 
including 1 (but not the number itself), is equal to the number. For example, 6 is a perfect number, 
because 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. Write a function isPerfect that determines whether parameter number is a
perfect number. Use this function in a program that determines and prints all the perfect numbers
between 1 and 1000. Print the divisors of each perfect number to confirm that the number is indeed
perfect.
