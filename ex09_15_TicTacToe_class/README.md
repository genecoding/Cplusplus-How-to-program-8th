9.15 (TicTacToe Class) Create a class TicTacToe that will enable you to write a complete program
to play the game of tic-tac-toe. The class contains as private data a 3-by-3 two-dimensional array
of integers. The constructor should initialize the empty board to all zeros. Allow two human players.
Wherever the first player moves, place a 1 in the specified square. Place a 2 wherever the second 
player moves. Each move must be to an empty square. After each move, determine whether the game
has been won or is a draw. If you feel ambitious, modify your program so that the computer makes
the moves for one of the players. Also, allow the player to specify whether he or she wants to go first
or second.
