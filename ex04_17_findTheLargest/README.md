4.17 (Find the Largest) Write a C++ program that uses a while statement to determine 
and print the largest number of 10 numbers input by the user. Your program should use
three variables, as follows:  
counter: A counter to count to 10 (i.e., to keep track of how many numbers have
been input and to determine when all 10 numbers have been processed).  
number: The current number input to the program.  
largest: The largest number found so far.

4.19 (Find the Two Largest Numbers) Using an approach similar to that in Exercise 4.17, find
the two largest values among the 10 numbers. [Note: You must input each number only once.]
